        "\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\"\n",
        "which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). The main principles are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Enables new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class.\n",
        "It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",

        "Q-3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity that contains both data (attributes) and methods (functions) to manipulate that data. Objects represent real-world entities and concepts in a program and allow for modularity and reusability of code.\n",

        "Q-4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that, although related, serve distinct purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "Function: It provides a simplified, clear interface to the user, making it easier to interact with objects without knowing the internal workings.\n",
        "Example: A car's dashboard is an abstraction; you interact with the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons without needing to understand the internal mechanics of the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n",
        "It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "Function: It protects the object's internal state and ensures that data is accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces.\n",
        "Example: In a car, the engine is encapsulated; you can't directly interact with or modify its inner components, but you can start and stop it using a key or button.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, abstraction simplifies interaction by highlighting important aspects and hiding complexity, while encapsulation safeguards the internal state of objects by\n",
        "restricting access and bundling data with methods.\n",
        "Both concepts work together to enhance code modularity, maintainability, and security.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q-5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods and also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores\n",
        "(e.g., __init__, __str__). These methods enable objects to support and implement behaviors typically associated with built-in types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an overview of some common dunder methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "__init__: Initializes a new object instance. It's called when an object is created from a class and allows the class to initialize the attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",

        "        self.year = year\n",
        "\n",

        "print(car)  # Output: 2022 Toyota Corolla\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__: Returns an \"official\" string representation of the object, often used for debugging.\n",
        "class Car:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-6  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called the child or subclass) to inherit attributes\n",
        "and methods from an existing class (called the parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are key aspects of inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Inheritance enables the child class to reuse code from the parent class, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.\n",
        "2. Hierarchical Relationships: It establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. For example, a `Dog` class can inherit from an `Animal` class,\n",
        "indicating that a dog is a type of animal.\n",
        "3. Method Overriding: The child class can override methods of the parent class to provide specialized behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Parent class\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- `Animal` is the parent class with an attribute `name` and a method `sound`.\n",
        "- `Dog` is the child class that inherits from `Animal`, adds a new attribute `breed`, and overrides the `sound` method to provide a specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows for creating a clear and maintainable structure in your code by reusing and extending existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-7  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "It enables methods to operate on objects of different classes, provided they share a common interface, typically through inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two types of polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):\n",
        "This occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. The correct method is chosen at compile time based on the method signature.\n",

        "Q-8 How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Encapsulation in Python is achieved through the use of classes and access modifiers (primarily by convention). Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes)\n",
        "and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Private Attributes and Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "By convention, attributes and methods that are intended to be private (i.e., not accessible outside the class) are prefixed with an underscore (_) or double underscore (__).\n",
        "A single underscore indicates that the attribute or method is intended for internal use, but it is still accessible from outside the class.\n",
        "A double underscore invokes name mangling, which makes the attribute or method harder to access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Getter and Setter Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation can be further enforced by using getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Method overriding is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method\n",
        "that is already defined in its superclass. This enables the subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the method inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main points about method overriding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Method overriding occurs in a hierarchical class structure where a subclass inherits from a superclass.\n",
        "Same Method Signature: The overridden method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.\n",
        "Run-Time Polymorphism: Method overriding supports run-time polymorphism, allowing the program to decide at runtime which method to call, based on the object type.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, a property decorator (@property) is used to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "It allows you to encapsulate instance variables, providing getter, setter, and deleter functionalities in a Pythonic way.\n",
        "By using the @property decorator, you can create read-only, read-write, or even computed properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Getter: The @property decorator is applied to a method to make it a getter for an attribute.\n",
        "Setter: The @<attribute>.setter decorator is applied to another method to define a setter for the same attribute.\n",
        "Deleter: The @<attribute>.deleter decorator is applied to a method to define a deleter for the same attribute.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Polymorphism is a vital concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enhances code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "Here are some reasons why polymorphism is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Flexibility: Polymorphism allows methods to operate on objects of different classes, provided they share a common interface.\n",
        "This means you can write more generic and flexible code. For example, you can create a function that processes different types of\n",
        "shapes (circle, square, triangle) without knowing their specific classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Behavior: Polymorphism enables dynamic method resolution at runtime. This means the method to be executed is determined based on the actual object's type,\n",
        "allowing for more dynamic and adaptive code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: By using polymorphism, you can reuse existing code without modification. For example, you can extend a base class and override\n",
        "its methods to provide specialized behavior, while still using the base class's methods and attributes.\n",
        "Simplified Code Maintenance: Polymorphism allows you to manage and extend code more efficiently.\n",
        "Changes in the base class or interface are automatically reflected in all derived classes, reducing the need for code duplication and making maintenance easier.\n",
        "Improved Code Organization: Polymorphism encourages a cleaner and more logical class hierarchy. It promotes the use of interfaces and abstract classes,\n",
        "leading to a more organized and modular codebase.\n",
        "Here's a quick example demonstrating polymorphism in Python:\n",

        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a widely adopted programming paradigm. Here are some key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces by creating classes.\n",
        "Each class represents a specific part of the problem, making the code more organized and modular.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: OOP promotes reusability through inheritance. You can create new classes that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes,\n",
        "reducing code duplication and saving development time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: OOP enables encapsulation, which bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
        "This protects the internal state of an object and ensures that it is accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces, improving data integrity and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to operate on objects of different classes through a common interface. This flexibility enables you to\n",
        "write more generic and adaptable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ease of Maintenance: OOP's modular structure makes it easier to maintain and update code. Changes in one part of the codebase are less likely to\n",
        "impact other parts, leading to fewer bugs and easier debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Productivity: OOP's principles, such as code reusability and modularity, lead to improved productivity. Developers can leverage existing code,\n",
        "focus on specific components, and collaborate more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-World Modeling: OOP allows you to model real-world entities and relationships more naturally. Classes and objects can represent real-world concepts,\n",
        "making the code more intuitive and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensibility: OOP supports extensibility by allowing you to extend existing classes with new functionality. You can create subclasses\n",
        "that add or override methods and attributes, enabling you to adapt and extend the codebase as requirements change.\n",

        "Concise Code: It reduces the need for repetitive variable assignments, leading to more concise and elegant code.\n",
        "Improved Readability: Chaining methods can make code easier to read and understand, especially when performing a series of related actions.\n",
        "Method chaining is a powerful technique that can enhance the readability and fluency of your Python code, making it more expressive and natural to work with.\n",

        "Q-25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, the __call__ method is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function.\n",
        "By defining the __call__ method in a class, you can enable its instances to be called with arguments, just like functions.\n",
        "This can be useful for creating objects that act as callable, customizable functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of __call__ Method:\n",
        "Callable Instances: It allows you to make instances of a class callable, enabling them to be used like functions.\n",
        "Custom Functionality: You can define custom behavior that gets executed when the instance is called.\n",
        "Higher-Order Functions: It can be used to create higher-order functions or function-like objects that maintain state or configuration.\n",

        "In this example:\n",
        "The Multiplier class defines an __init__ method to initialize the multiplication factor and an __call__ method to perform the multiplication.\n",
        "Instances of Multiplier (e.g., double and triple) are created with different factors.\n",
        "The instances can be called with a value, and the __call__ method is executed, returning the multiplied result.\n",
        "The __call__ method enhances the versatility and flexibility of objects by allowing them to function as callable entities,\n",
        "adding a layer of functionality to your classes.\n",
